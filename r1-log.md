# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Mohamed Bouzar

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [October 30, Thursday, 2025].

## Log

### R1D1 
Started a new project using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Set up the initial project structure and created a simple homepage.

### R1D2
Built the global layout for the project with reusable components like Navbar, Footer, and Sidebar. Integrated responsive design using TailwindCSS and configured the color palette.

### R1D3
Developed core features of the project including Subtitle Automation, Audio Editor, and Background Removal. Implemented file upload, transcription simulation, waveform visualization, and background removal functionalities.

### R1D4
Added a fully designed authentication UI (Sign In / Sign Up) with dedicated layouts for a clean, user-friendly experience. Included placeholders for social OAuth (Google, Facebook, etc.) to prepare for future integrations. Worked on client-side connections and dynamic imports for heavy libraries to improve performance and reduce bundle size.

### R1D5
Started building the backend API using Node.js and Express. Set up the project structure, environment configuration, and initial endpoints. Defined routes and controller patterns for handling tool operations (upload, convert, export). Prepared the API for future integrations with authentication and media processing.

### R1D6
- Integrated **Node.js API** with a **Python microservice** using **OpenAI Whisper** for AI-powered transcription.  
- Connected MediaKit’s **frontend and backend**, enabling real **subtitle generation** directly from uploaded media.
- Improved API flow for audio upload, processing, and returning transcription results to the client.

### R1D7
- Developed the **background removal** feature using a **Node.js backend** integrated with a **Python microservice** leveraging **TensorFlow.js** and **BodyPix** for image segmentation.  
- Enabled users to upload images, process them server-side to remove backgrounds, and return transparent PNGs.

### R1D8
- Refactored backend logic for **background removal** to enhance performance and readability.
- Integrated **Sequelize ORM** and created a **User model**.
- Implemented **authentication system** (sign-up, sign-in).
  

### R1D9
- No coding today - I have a fever 🤒 so I'm taking a break.
- Sometimes the best way to move forward is to stop and rest.
- Tomorrow I'll be back to the challenge stronger than ever! 🚀 💪  


### R1D10
- After finishing the main tools for MediaKit, I focused on improving the foundation
- I learned more about Next.js, Prisma, and NextAuth, and refactored my Node.js backend into a unified Next.js API.
- Clean code = clearer mind = better problem solving 💡💪

### R1D11
- Implemented **OAuth authentication** using **NextAuth.js** with providers like Google, Facebook, and X (Twitter).  
- Enhanced user experience with smooth sign-in/sign-up flows and session management.
- It forced me to think about user flow, security, and session handling - a great exercise in problem-solving and backend logic.  
- Super happy with today's progress!

### R1D12
- I completed the refactoring of the MediaKit project and migrated the entire backend to Next.js, making it a truly fullstack app! 🎉

### R1D13
- Started Dockerizing the full project (Next.js fullstack + Python microservice)  
- Set up production-ready Docker configurations

### R1D14
- Complete the project's Dockerization
- Created Docker Compose setup for easy local development and testing
- Learned a lot about containerization and deployment best practices
- Feeling more confident about deploying fullstack applications now!
