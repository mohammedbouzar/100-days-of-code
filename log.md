# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 31, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Started a MediaKit using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Focused on setting up the project structure and initial configurations.

**Thoughts:** Excited to kick off this new project! Next.js and Tailwind CSS are powerful tools, and I'm eager to see how they can enhance my development workflow.

### Day 1: November 1, 2025

**Today's Progress:**  
Built the global layout for MediaKit with reusable components — Navbar, Footer, and Sidebar.  
Integrated responsive design using TailwindCSS and configured the color palette.

**Thoughts:**  
It feels great to see the app starting to take shape visually. Next.js and Tailwind make structuring and styling really efficient. Tomorrow I'll start working on the Home Page hero section and feature grid.

### Day 2: November 2, 2025

**Today's Progress:**  
Made major progress on MediaKit's core tools — Subtitle Automation, Audio Editor, and Background Removal.
Integrated features:
- Subtitle Automation: upload → simulated transcription → SRT export  
- Audio Editor: waveform via Wavesurfer.js, draggable regions, trimming, and MP3/WAV export  
- Background Removal: BodyPix segmentation → transparent PNG output  

Fixed navbar issues, optimized exports for GH Pages, and solved multiple hydration bugs.
Project is now feature-complete for its MVP phase.

**Thoughts:**  
The foundation is solid — moving from prototype to polished tools now feels within reach. Excited to refine, test, and optimize performance next!

### Day 3: November 3, 2025

**Today's Progress:**  
Added a fully designed **authentication UI** (Sign In / Sign Up) with dedicated layouts for a clean, user-friendly experience.  
Included placeholders for **social OAuth** (Google, Facebook, etc.) to prepare for future integrations.  
Also worked on **client-side connections** and **dynamic imports** for heavy libraries to improve performance and reduce bundle size.  

**Thoughts:**  
It's starting to look and feel like a real app now!  
Designing a smooth authentication experience makes everything come together visually and functionally.  
Excited to integrate OAuth next and make sign-ins lightning fast.
