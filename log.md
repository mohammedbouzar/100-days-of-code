# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 31, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Started a MediaKit using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Focused on setting up the project structure and initial configurations.

**Thoughts:** Excited to kick off this new project! Next.js and Tailwind CSS are powerful tools, and I'm eager to see how they can enhance my development workflow.

### Day 1: November 1, 2025

**Today's Progress:**  
Built the global layout for MediaKit with reusable components — Navbar, Footer, and Sidebar.  
Integrated responsive design using TailwindCSS and configured the color palette.

**Thoughts:**  
It feels great to see the app starting to take shape visually. Next.js and Tailwind make structuring and styling really efficient. Tomorrow I'll start working on the Home Page hero section and feature grid.

### Day 2: November 2, 2025

**Today's Progress:**  
Made major progress on MediaKit's core tools — Subtitle Automation, Audio Editor, and Background Removal.
Integrated features:
- Subtitle Automation: upload → simulated transcription → SRT export  
- Audio Editor: waveform via Wavesurfer.js, draggable regions, trimming, and MP3/WAV export  
- Background Removal: BodyPix segmentation → transparent PNG output  

Fixed navbar issues, optimized exports for GH Pages, and solved multiple hydration bugs.
Project is now feature-complete for its MVP phase.

**Thoughts:**  
The foundation is solid — moving from prototype to polished tools now feels within reach. Excited to refine, test, and optimize performance next!

### Day 3: November 3, 2025

**Today's Progress:**  
Added a fully designed **authentication UI** (Sign In / Sign Up) with dedicated layouts for a clean, user-friendly experience.  
Included placeholders for **social OAuth** (Google, Facebook, etc.) to prepare for future integrations.  
Also worked on **client-side connections** and **dynamic imports** for heavy libraries to improve performance and reduce bundle size.  

**Thoughts:**  
It's starting to look and feel like a real app now!  
Designing a smooth authentication experience makes everything come together visually and functionally.  
Excited to integrate OAuth next and make sign-ins lightning fast.

### Day 4: November 4, 2025

**Today's Progress:**  
Started building the **backend API** using **Node.js** and Express.  
Set up the project structure, environment configuration, and initial endpoints.  
Defined routes and controller patterns for handling tool operations. 
Prepared the API for future integrations with authentication and media processing.

**Thoughts:**  
Feels great to switch gears from UI to backend logic!

### Day 5: November 5, 2025

**Today's Progress:**  
- Integrated **Node.js API** with a **Python microservice** using **OpenAI Whisper** for AI-powered transcription.  
- Connected MediaKit's **frontend and backend**, enabling real **subtitle generation** directly from uploaded media.  
- Improved API flow for audio upload, processing, and returning transcription results to the client.  

**Thoughts:**  
Super excited today! 🚀 Seeing AI and full-stack integration come together feels incredibly rewarding.  
This marks a huge step — MediaKit is officially creating real, usable subtitles with the power of AI.  
Onward to refining accuracy and expanding to more tools!

### Day 6: November 7, 2025

**Today's Progress:**  
- Implemented **background removal** on the **server side** instead of only frontend.  
- Integrated **Python** backend tools — **Pillow** and **rembg** — to handle accurate background segmentation and transparent image output.  
- Linked this new Python service with the **Node.js API**, enabling the frontend to send images and receive processed results seamlessly.  
- Improved performance and stability by offloading heavy image processing from the browser to the server.

**Thoughts:**  
Really satisfying progress today! 🎨  
Seeing the background removal feature running entirely on the backend feels like a big step forward for MediaKit.  
Server-side processing opens the door for faster, more reliable, and scalable tools. Excited to keep refining it!

### Day 7: November 8, 2025  

**Today's Progress:**  
- Refactored backend logic for **background removal** to enhance performance and readability.  
- Integrated **Sequelize ORM** and created a **User model**.  
- Implemented **authentication system** (sign-up, sign-in).

### Day 8: November 9, 2025  

**Today's Progress:**  
No coding today - I caught a fever and took time to rest and recover.  

**Thoughts:**  
Sometimes the best way to move forward is to stop and rest.
Tomorrow I'll be back to the challenge stronger than ever! 🚀 💪

### Day 9: November 10, 2025  

**Today's Progress:**  
- Learned more about **Next.js**, especially SSR vs CSR.  
- Explored **Prisma** ORM and **NextAuth** integration.  
- Refactored backend code from Node.js to Next.js API routes.  
- Kept a minimal **Python microservice** for AI tool processing.  

**Thoughts:**  
Refactoring helped streamline the architecture and make the app more flexible. Clean code design not only improves scalability but also sharpens problem-solving skills — you learn to think structurally, not just syntactically.

### Day 10: November 11, 2025

**Today's Progress:**  
- Completed authentication system using **NextAuth**  
- Added **Google, Facebook, X (Twitter)**, and **Credentials** providers  
- Implemented middleware for route and session protection  
- Refactored code for better scalability and structure

**Thoughts:**  
Authentication is a key building block for secure apps.  
It forced me to think about user flow, security, and session handling — a great exercise in problem-solving and backend logic.  
Super happy with today's progress!

### Day 11: November 12, 2025

**Today's Progress:**  
- Finished full **code refactor**  
- Migrated backend logic entirely into **Next.js** (no more separate Node.js server)  
- Verified fullstack functionality — API routes, database, auth, and AI integrations  
- Project is now running seamlessly under one stack  
- Gained deeper knowledge about **Next.js fullstack capabilities**, **API routes**, and **maintainability**

**Thoughts:**  
This refactor was a turning point! It improved performance, simplified deployment, and made the project easier to scale and maintain.  
I learned a lot about structure, abstraction, and fullstack integration — it feels awesome to see everything come together! 🙌
