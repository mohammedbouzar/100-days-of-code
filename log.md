# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 30, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Started a MediaKit using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Focused on setting up the project structure and initial configurations.

**Thoughts:** Excited to kick off this new project! Next.js and Tailwind CSS are powerful tools, and I'm eager to see how they can enhance my development workflow.
